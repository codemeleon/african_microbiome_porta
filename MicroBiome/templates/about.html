<H3>Context</H3>
<p><strong>The African Human Microbiome Portal (AHMP)</strong> is an <strong><a href='https://www.h3abionet.org/'>H3Africa</a></strong> initiative to establish a centralized repository for microbiome metadata associated with African human populations. Through this collection of African microbiome metadata, the African Microbiome Portal aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mt-4">Provide free and open access to publicly available African human microbiome-related metadata that are curated, interactively displayed, and easily downloadable.</li>
<li class="mt-4">Provide the most rapid and comprehensive overview of all existing African microbiome metadata.  The metadata that are represented here are extended to include information on the sequencing technology, sample types. The AMP provides a description of  the studied population features such as ethnicity, country of origin, diet, lifestyle, and health status. Moreover, it also gives access to the  linkage URLs to the original publications and sequences repository.</li>
<li class="mt-4">Enable the submission of newly published metadata according to submission guidelines. The submitted information is further curated prior to its public availability on the portal.  This is an opportunity  for researchers with common scientific objectives to contribute to the scientific community by sharing and submitting their new metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>More broadly, the African Microbiome Portal serves as a gateway to publications, preprints, news, events,  and resources related to the African microbiome. Various hackathons were held to accelerate this collaboration (https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baab016)</p>


<H3>Contributors</H3>
<p>The development of the Human African Microbiome Portal is the fruit of a collaborating consortium composed of the Human Heredity and Health in Africa’s (H3Africa) Bioinformatics Network (H3ABioNet). H3ABioNet is funded by NIH Common Fund Award / NHGRI Grant Number U41HG006941.</p>

<p>Development of the AHMP was driven by H3ABioNet’s Databases and Resources Work Package.</p>

<H3>Version</H3>
<p>HAMP v1.0 - released TBD Date</p>
